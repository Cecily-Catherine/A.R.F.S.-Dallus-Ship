He doesn&#39;t say a word, cut off by the sight of Gunner presenting himself. He exhales quietly through his teeth, stepping forward, shakily bringing his hands up to Gunner&#39;s shoulders. Slowly, the possum tugs and pulls at the hoodie, working it off of the raccoon.

[04:06:14]EMOTE: Alec Lasko/Silvertail : <B>Alec Lasko</B> lets out a few quiet, indistinct squeaks, eyes darting all over Gunner&#39;s body. He steps back slightly, putting one leg in front of the other, his tail curling by his feet - His new posture does little to coneal his crotch, red starting to poke out from the tip of the possum&#39;s sheath. Shakily, he reaches forward once more, hands ever-so-softly trailing over Gunner&#39;s chest.. Their jumpsuit&#39;s zipper..

[04:13:42]EMOTE: Alec Lasko/Silvertail : <B>Alec Lasko</B> lets out a little squeak as Gunner&#39;s clothes fall away, his cock throbbing in his sheath, steadily poking out further and further. It reaches its peak as Gunner presses against him, leaving the possum quivering where he stands, breathing shakily as ever. Alec&#39;s length comes to about five inches long, tapered to a wide base at the sheath. He&#39;s panting hard, his heart racing. He&#39;s mouthing every variety of word, but he doesn&#39;t get a sound out.
[04:14:54]SAY: Serena Rhinehart/Mechanicus Adept : Meteors, Meteors, Meteors.
[04:15:16]SAY: Serena Rhinehart/Mechanicus Adept : So nice to deal with.
[04:15:29]SAY: Serena Rhinehart/Mechanicus Adept : Tye, are you okay?
[04:15:36]EMOTE: Gunner Smirnov/KriegsmarineOffizier : <B>Gunner Smirnov</B> only gives him a sly, perverted look as he leans him, kissing him on the lips, then the cheek, and right behind the ear, then slowly moving down, chest, belly, groin, right till he&#39;s on his knee&#39;s, and placing a kiss right on the possums tip. &#34;Since ... we don&#39;t have long ... I might as well give you something to enjoy~
[04:15:40]SAY: Tye Riggle/ThingPony : Yeah Just..moving really slow
[04:16:03]SAY: Serena Rhinehart/Mechanicus Adept : Feeling peckish?
[04:16:25]SAY: Serena Rhinehart/Mechanicus Adept : Gunner is probably hiding out with Alec.

[04:20:51]EMOTE: Alec Lasko/Silvertail : <B>Alec Lasko</B> continues to quake where he stands, his eyes barely open as Gunner drops in front of him, the constant kissing, touching.. It&#39;s leaving Alec as quiet as ever, beyond the sounds of his frantic breathing. The instant his cock gets a lick, he squirts precum, the salty stuff splattering against Gunner&#39;s lips. The possum moans through his teeth, left hand shooting out against the wall beside him for support. &#34;H-Haah-&#34;

[04:23:19]EMOTE: Gunner Smirnov/KriegsmarineOffizier : <B>Gunner Smirnov</B> glances at his PDA and shrugs, not really caring now, as he slowly wraps his lips around the possums tip, delightfully slurping down the precum that still dribbled, leaving the rest on his lips as he quickly got to work, pressing his muzzle down on his cock, tongue working at his underside the entire time, till he fully took the entire five inches down, tip pressed happily against his throat. He&#39;d bring one paw up, fondling the Possums sack rather happily in the process.

The sudden shift to zero-G comes as a bit of a surprise, getting a frightened squeak out of Alec, quick to take a hold of Gunner, inadvertantly thrusting into the raccoon&#39;s mouth, giving him a proper facefull of soft, warm crotchfur. Lewd.
