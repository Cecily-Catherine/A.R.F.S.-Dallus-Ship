Smearing some pre on his cheek for his troubles. Doesn&#39;t stop there though, the sergal grabbing ahold of Zander&#39;s face and... smoooshing his face against his crotch, Areesh arching his back as he grinds his cock and balls all over the poor neko&#39;s face.

[10:49:34]EMOTE: Zander Sylphaen/Twilightic : <B>Zander Sylphaen</B> &#34;Urghn...&#34; Zander grunted as the other brought his ass down on his chest, making it a bit difficult to breath at first as he humped his way further up. He flinched as the sizable cock that Areesh was sporting, smached him inthe face, the scent of musk and sweat now  reaching his nose. He cringed slightly as the sergal rubbed the pre on his cheek. &#34;TH-THAT IS DISGUSTING!! GET THE FUCK OF-MMPHH...&#34; Zander was muffled as he was forced face first into his musky crotch, the scent being grinded into him. He attempted to pull away, only causing him pain due to the sharp of the other&#39;s claws. He tried to call out for help again, though, instantly, the large balls on his face tried to fill out his open mouth.&#34;

At least in this manner... Time to move on to the next part of his torment... Areesh carelessly drops Zander&#39;s head, letting it smack against the floor... and moving to sit on his face. Wiggling his rump atop the poor catboy... forcing his weight down, Zander starting to sink in betweem those fluffy rumpcheeks~
