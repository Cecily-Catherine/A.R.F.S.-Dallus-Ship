A small trail of saliva attaching the fingers to her tongue...  The wet digits move down, first swirling onto that same nipple, coating it in vixen drool.  Then she pinches it, the little moan coming out of her a clear sign of her arrousal.  Slowly soaking panties aside.

[15:47:57]SAY: Ghost/Theoun : if they&#39;re so bad, they shouldn&#39;t be in the code. if they ARE in the code, you should expect traitors to deploy them in strategic locations

That&#39;s a new one...&#34;  Without much thought she slides down a bit so her butt is on the edge of the chair and kicks her legs up onto the consoles keyboard rim.  Her tails splaying out to one side.  It looks comfy, sort of.  But it also looks like she&#39; probably fall if someone moved the chair just a little bit in the wrong direction.  Her hands pull the sec-sunglasses from their nestled safe spot between her breasts, and she unfolds one side and begins lightly nibbling on the frame.  &#34;So, the crew up to anything out there?  I heard someone doing something in surgery while I was in medbay.&#34;

Her head just slightly lower than his.  &#34;You poor boy... you&#39;re so sweet.   You&#39;ll have to take me out sometime.  I&#39;d like that.&#34;  Her tone totally serious, and in one smooth motion she reaches up, pulling his lips down to hers, locking them together in a kiss.  Soft lip nibbles follow, any fighting back is met with a firm grip from her.  After a bit, she does let go of his head.

Had to show the new Roboticist how to find their department.  Then I had to direct Marc around to breaches.  All the while hoping we get actual security or a head of staff.  And not that rookie CMO again.  They tried to kit me out in riot gear the other day, did you know that?&#34;
[04:10:21]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : I was a doctor first and foremost, C-OWWWW

[04:12:47]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Lemme fix the bits

[04:13:17]EMOTE: Xena/ : <B>Xena</B> shakes its head
[04:13:24]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : Now, to put both of these in secure locations. Anything else we should handle?
[04:13:29]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : I am stillinjured?
[04:13:33]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Lemme scan
[04:13:36]SAY: Huli 'Ming' Zhiming/Tk420634 : I think that&#39;s it for in here, sir.

[04:14:12]EMOTE: Frank/ : <B>Frank</B> chases its tail.
[04:14:12]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Yes
[04:14:17]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : Understood. Then I should go put these in secure locations, and then make sure there isn&#39;t anything majorly wrong afterward.
[04:14:21]SAY: Camile Toriate/Annoymous35 : Kind of a quiet shift, huh?
[04:14:22]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Ye be fixed
[04:14:32]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : I SHALL GO AFTER THE EYES!
[04:14:34]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Grab this welder
[04:14:48]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : Where?
[04:14:50]SAY: Huli 'Ming' Zhiming/Tk420634 : That&#39;s on you, sir.  I&#39;d keep them on yourself, though.  Probably safer than somewhere that might get broken into by an operative.
[04:14:52]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : Would you rather it be filled with worse things than eyeballs lurking outside the ship, a spider attack, and bloody &#39;ell knows what else?
[04:14:52]SAY: Poly/ : I Remember each timer is 30 seconds.
[04:14:54]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Also gear
[04:15:19]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Enjoy~
[04:15:23]SAY: Camile Toriate/Annoymous35 : Well...
[04:15:32]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : Should I use the hammer or the scythe?
[04:15:36]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : True, but keeping them on my person just means that all an operative has to do is take me down and loot both off my body. That&#39;s not much better, in the end.
[04:15:39]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Jackhammer does more damage
[04:15:40]SAY: Camile Toriate/Annoymous35 : I&#39;d expect maybe there&#39;d be something fun going on.
[04:15:44]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : I hope
[04:15:47]SAY: Camile Toriate/Annoymous35 : Like people wanting to be borged.
[04:15:57]SAY: Camile Toriate/Annoymous35 : Or turned into AIs.
[04:16:00]SAY: Huli 'Ming' Zhiming/Tk420634 : Except that we have someone constantly checking your vitals, and can alert the whole crew to rescue you.  But again, your call, sir.
[04:16:18]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : Thank hyou~
[04:16:22]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Ready?
[04:16:25]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : Better to keep both in separate locations, after all. Should at least put the spare ID somewhere safe - that way, there&#39;s always a way to get to any operatives trying to arm the nuke.
[04:16:28]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : Wait
[04:16:29]GAME: Random Event triggering: Communications Blackout (/datum/round_event/communications_blackout)

[04:16:42]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Tis shift eeend
[04:16:43]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : ...Or the shift can be over. I suppose that doesn&#39;t quite matter, in the end.
[04:16:44]SAY: Huli 'Ming' Zhiming/Tk420634 : Well, that answers that problem all together...
[04:16:51]SAY: Camile Toriate/Annoymous35 : So uh... where exactly does the shuttle lead to?
[04:17:04]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : Should still secure the ID, in the event that we get someone&#39;s wish for more action.
[04:17:12]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : THE EYES SHALL PAY!!!
[04:17:20]SAY: Xena/ : Esp!
[04:17:21]SAY: Camile Toriate/Annoymous35 : So uh... where exactly does the shuttle go to?
[04:17:24]EMOTE: Huli 'Ming' Zhiming/Tk420634 : <B>Huli 'Ming' Zhiming</B> nods, &#34;You really should shuffle through this bag.  There&#39;s some items that should be secured in it.  Like the Katana.&#34;
[04:17:38]SAY: grey baby slime (744)/ : Very... hungry...
[04:17:40]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : Because of aforementioned reasoning of still having potential operatives delayed some.
[04:17:57]EMOTE: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : <B>Jingle-Jangle Every Angle</B> gasps!
[04:18:16]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Mrow
[04:18:17]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : Well...the katana&#39;s certainly something to do something about.
[04:18:19]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : OW
[04:18:23]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Any eyeballs out there?
[04:18:26]SAY: Huli 'Ming' Zhiming/Tk420634 : Venri, do you have a spare can of spray paint for the shuttle?
[04:18:28]EMOTE: Frank/ : <B>Frank</B> chases its tail.
[04:18:32]SAY: Huli 'Ming' Zhiming/Tk420634 : Oh, comms are down...
[04:18:43]SAY: John Gregor/Alwayssilent : Mmm, wonderful.
[04:18:49]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : ...Tempted to keep it on my person, in the event it&#39;s a good idea, but like any good plan, it&#39;s equally liable to become a bad plan.
[04:19:07]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Fixed the breach over there
[04:19:27]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Mech RCD is grand
[04:19:33]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Ranged construction
[04:19:36]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : Observe
[04:19:44]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : The only other thing that could be considered dangerous in the bag is the jackhammer, but it&#39;s actually not that much stronger than a pickaxe. It&#39;s just faster at mining and strong enough to deal with walls.
[04:20:05]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : Observing
[04:20:24]EMOTE: Huli 'Ming' Zhiming/Tk420634 : <B>Huli 'Ming' Zhiming</B> nods, &#34;Probably shouldn&#39;t be left laying about.  Not that it matters much, since everyones going home shortly.&#34;
[04:20:26]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : Observing
[04:20:28]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : So if you can get massacred by a pickaxe, you&#39;ll be liable to get the same done to you with the jackhammer. Funny how tech works like that.
[04:20:32]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : AGH
[04:20:32]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : But valid point.
[04:20:41]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : COMS ARE DOWN

[04:20:46]SAY: Venri Voltari/kevak : I noticed
[04:20:53]SAY: Rising Flames/Ruby Flamewing : Well, I&#39;m going to go secure these right quick, and return to here afterward.
[04:20:54]SAY: Jingle-Jangle Every Angle/Twilightic : I shall hunt the balls who did this

She pauses, closes her mouth and swallows, letting out a low scentence... &#34;This always makes my mouth water, one moment...&#34;  After a little gulp, she opens her mouth again, resting the head of the toy against her tongue.  A small rolling motion follows from that little pink appendage, and then she begins actively licking the toy down.   Once she&#39;s given it a nice coating of girl spit... she just kind of... well.  Pushes the whole thing to the base into her mouth.  A small, but visable, bulge showing in her throat.   After about five or six seconds she slowly slides it out, and casually wipes the toy on her satchel, before tossing it into the bag.
