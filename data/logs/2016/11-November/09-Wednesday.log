[05:39:15]EMOTE: Hu Li Ming/Tk420634 : <B>Hu Li Ming</B> pulls the panties up over the dildos base, covering it.  The toys bottom clearly bulging the panties out some as she pulls her butt up, legs coming together.  The panties get slid off with her hands shortly afterwards, and reveal her wet nethers again.  The dildos base still visable, red against her orange fur and pink pussy.  &#34;Mmm... Something wrong... John?&#34;  Her hands move to her stomach, then push up under her sweater to reveal her bare breasts.  Huh, she never had a bra on.  The hand invading the space squeezes fitfully, causing just a little drop of milk to pop up at her nipple, which is quickly caught by her finger, and licked off.  &#34;You... want something?&#34;

Ah... Mm- You can take it&#39;s place... John...&#34;  She pulls her head back down, heavily lidded eyes locking with his.  &#34;Please... do.&#34;  Her hand still on the toy, working it slightly in and out.  The knot never quite coming free, it&#39;s not terribly large anyways.  It&#39;d be fairly easy to pull out.

[07:10:06]SAY: Sharknet/Ruby Flamewing : It might have to do with slime people actually being toxic beings themselves. Like how, in an irradiated land I once made a few trips to, there were residents there so horribly mutated by the radiation that it HEALED them rather than harmed them, and the treatment options for radiation sickness was lethal to them.

[18:42:19]EMOTE: Grayson Hayes/Santano64neo : <B>Grayson Hayes</B> wriggled around a little as he was pressed between the two. Wolfy&#39;s weight had pushed his pelvis down, prompting his erect length to poke and prod at Eira&#39;s sex before slowly sliding into the folds. Behind him, his tail twitched, the raccoon wincing a little as he felt Wolfy settling atop of it.

She continues kissing Eira, moving to her cheek and then her ears, her paw moving to stroke the fennec&#39;s tail softly. She couldn&#39;t really do much with Grayson, considering their positioning, but she moves one hand to rub at his head, her arm at an awkward angle to achieve the headrubs

[18:59:20]EMOTE: Grayson Hayes/Santano64neo : <B>Grayson Hayes</B> began to pant softly; Wolfy&#39;s gentle humping thrusting his length into and out of Eira&#39;s glistening folds. He managed to wriggle his arms somewhat free, and his hands came to a rest on the fennec&#39;s hips, where he began to lightly knead and massage his fingers into. With some effort, he manages to twist his head at just the right angle to open it. His tongue lolls out, snaking between a pair of mashed breasts and stimulating a nipple of both Wolfy and Eira. A happy murr escapes his throat in response to the combined rubbing by Eira and Wolfy, his tail twitching in pleasure.
[18:59:32]SAY: Javier Lafortune/Secondattemps : I have two, and you know this fully well~

She would move her free paw to rub gently over wolfy&#39;s rear, then the bse of her tail~ squeazing and giving  entle tug now and again. her own voice moaning softly into this kiss, she might shudder a bit with the combined sensation of a more proper mating, and loving stroking over the fennecs tail.

She gently nibbles at Eira&#39;s lips, before forcing her tongue into the fennec&#39;s lips, exploring the mouth slowly. She moves her own hands down to give the fluffy white ass of the fennec a tight squeeze, moaning some more as Grayson llicked at her hard nipple, causing her to press down further, rubbing it against the fennec&#39;s

[19:15:23]EMOTE: Grayson Hayes/Santano64neo : <B>Grayson Hayes</B> very lightly nipped at the breasts, occasionally sweeping his tongue between the two nipples. His massaging of Eira&#39;s hips slowed somwhat, his hands once again roaming the fennec&#39;s body. They soon come to a rest on the Fennec&#39;s fluffy tail, and he, too, began to lightly stroke and massage the appendage. the raccoon shifted his hips a little, his length now sliding more forcefully along Eira&#39;s inner walls in response. The free part of his tail curled and began to wave in the air, lightly batting at Wolfy&#39;s rear.
[19:15:40]EMOTE: Marceline Lafortune/Malamarissa : <B>Marceline Lafortune</B> lets her tongue play with her brother&#39;s, slipping around behind his lips as she presses and grinds her body against his

His ear twitched in response to Wolfy&#39;s question. &#34;Y-You want the bone now, huh? W-Well... All right. N-Not sure how-- ngh!-- much longer I-I&#39;ll be able to hold back f-for, though!~&#34;

[19:33:39]EMOTE: Grayson Hayes/Santano64neo : <B>Grayson Hayes</B> moaned loudly as he tried to nod. Timing his movements with Wolfy&#39;s humping, his tail slowly slid along the wolf&#39;s sex. Slowly... until a fair bit of the base slipped in, eliciting a gasp from the raccoon. His own efforts seemed to double as well, hands roaming the parts of Eira&#39;s body as Wolfy pounded him into her. He moaned at the quick kiss that Eira slipped him then nodded firmly.
[19:33:52]ADMIN: PM: Cebutris/(Wolfy Tubek)->Twilightic/(Zander Sylphaen): It depends on the chemical. Different chemicals (and therefore different colors) have different effects. For instance, you may have a boiling oil blob, which is orange-ish, that does burn damage but is weak to brute, or a rippind tendril blob which is red, that does incredibly high brute damage but dies fairly quickly to burn damage. I reccomend you check the wiki for a better understanding
[19:33:53]EMOTE: Marceline Lafortune/Malamarissa : <B>Marceline Lafortune</B> squeezes her legs tighter against her brother in preperation for the soon to be rough entrance, her teeth bared into a slight nervous smile before giving him an encouraging kiss to the shoulder

[19:34:40]ADMIN: PM: Twilightic/(Zander Sylphaen)->Cebutris/(Wolfy Tubek): Like in my entire time playing ss13
[19:34:48]ADMIN: PM: Cebutris/(Wolfy Tubek)->Twilightic/(Zander Sylphaen): White blobs are made out of concentrated lameness, and they only spawn when a blob spawns and there's no player to take control. They're a billion times easier than player blobs

He practically clung to Eira as his rod twitched and pulses within her, the raccoon finally having reached climax and his shaft eagerly emptying it&#39;s load into the fennec! He moaned, his voice shaky and rising in pitch with every hump and thrust Wolfy gave. until, finally, his body relaxed, and he panted heavily.
