But it&#39;ll all be worth it soon~..&#34; as a small toothy grin crosses his mouth. It&#39;s at that point that John would slowly get onto the bed before sitting lightly apon Cecily&#39;s back.

Shaking his head again John would slowly lean down to whisper into her ear, &#34;Now now..~ I&#39;m not going to hurt you..Much~&#34; as his arms go forward to the ties and tightening them on her wrists and bed leg almost mockingly.

[11:05:38]EMOTE: John Gregor/Alwayssilent : <B>John Gregor</B> lets out a rather content grunt as he slowly moves himself forward slightly and right to the edge of the bed, turning around again so that he is facing her. Quiet, &#39;hmms&#39; would escape the wolves mouth as he thinks for a second before smiling to himself and grabbing Cecily&#39;s waist tightly before yanking it upwards so that he&#39;d basically force herself to present her behind to him. With a evil chuckle of sorts it&#39;s then that John would once again shuffle himself around, this time however he&#39;d end up with his groin being pressed right up against her rump, letting it sit there for a second he&#39;d quickly draw his right hand backwards before launching it fowards quickly, a loud clap sound would then echo from her right buttcheck as the hand slapped it.

As he yanked her waist upwards she would release a yelp into the muzzle as she began to try once more to free herself from his grasp. With his groin pressed against her back she involuntarily shivered at the realization of what he wanted from her before feeling his hand lift away from her and quickly return with a slow slap, eliciting a scream that could still be heard around the muzzle.

It&#39;s then that John, with a quiet groan of pleasure, starts to grind himself against her behind, a fairly large bulge being obvious to feel for her as it lightly throbs and pulses against ber clothed behind, John&#39;s other free hand would slowly make its way to her theigh where it&#39;d then ever so slowly start to trail itself up and down in a almost teasing manner, every so often getting ever so close to her own groin yet never quite reaching it.

A moment of rearranging and she pulls the mans legs as wide apart as she can get them and him still be comfortable and she moves forward.  Breasts, nipples in particular, pressing against his sack while her mouth works its way up one side and then the other of his cock.  Tongue teasing, and coating everything with her warm spit.  Locking eyes with him she stops her mouth at his cockhead, wrapping it with her lips and suckling lightly.  Tongue flicking across his helmet back and forth lightly for a moment.  She seems to be just hunting reactions for the time being...  Though, she&#39;s making content little noises the whole while.  She&#39;s obviously enjoying herself as well.

Well, there&#39;s one good one.  But I removed it because it was too good.  It was right next to the engine.  There are like 12 blob spawn points.
